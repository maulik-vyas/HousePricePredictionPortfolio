# HousePricePredictionPortfolio
House Price Prediction Project
The main object of this assignment is to examine a set of housing prices in Boston based upon a set of features. After successfully training this model on train data, if it is seen as a good fit then it could be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” particularly its price. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The Boston housing data was collected in the year 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. 

The raw data comprises training and test dataset in which training set has aforementioned attribues with the corresponding salaries while test dataset does not have salary information and would act as a real-world dataset.
